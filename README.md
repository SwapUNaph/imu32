# IMU 32
IMU 32 is a project to simplify working with MPU9250 imu sensors and STM32 ARM M1 microprocessors.

## MPU9250.h and MPU9250.c (TBD)
MPU9250.h provides interface which uses the HAL functionality of STM32 and helps in developing applications to interact with imu data.

## EKF.h (TBD) and EKF.c (TBD)
EKF.h provides the interface to implement the Extended Kalman filter algorithm which enables estimation of the orientation of the sensor with extreme accuracy.
